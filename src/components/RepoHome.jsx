        <p>
          The goal of this site is to provide a single place with all the known information about <a href="http://www.hellogames.org">Hello Games</a>' upcoming title <a href="http://nomanssky.com">No Man's Sky</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All information in this repository comes with the sources for that information, so you can go off and read the original articles for more detailed information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The repository was not designed to hold information about the discoveries that people make in the game. There are other websites (such as <a href="https://nmsorigins.com/">NMS Origins</a>) that are designed for that purpose.
