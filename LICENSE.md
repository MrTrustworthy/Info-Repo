# Info-Repo License

"Information Repository", "Info Repo", "Resository", and "Repo" refer to this GitHub repository (note the different casing of the word "repository"), any forks and clones of it, and the information presented (whether in this repository or elsewhere).  
"Me", and "I" refer to secret_online (the original author). "My" has similar meaning.  
"You" refers to, well, you. "Your" has similar meaning.

This license is in a more human-readable format, and thus may contain some abiguities. In these cases, ask Me and follow that.

This license may (but probably won't) change at any time, and it's Your responsibility to make sure You adhere to it.

**You can**:

* Use it!
* Fork, clone, contribute to the Repository.

**You can not**:

* Use the Repository for commercial purposes *unless*
  1. You acknowledge the Repository as the source
    * This can be just a link to https://repo.nmsdb.info, clearly visible
  2. You let Me know what you're doing
    * I'd like to know how people use this (for personal interest only)
    * I'd also like to make sure You're not breaking these conditions
