# Info-Repo

## [Visit the Repository](https://repo.nmsdb.info)

This is the home of the code that runs the No Man's Sky Information Repository.

The Repository is a project to have all the information about the game available and easily searchable/linkable. It doesn't store information about specific planets (or other things in the game) that have been discovered.

**DISCLAIMER**  
This project will likely be a mess for a long time, as I am using it to learn some stuff. You're welcome to help tidy it up if you'd like.
